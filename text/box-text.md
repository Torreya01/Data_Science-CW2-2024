Through the box plot of the data, you can visualize the distribution of house prices across 10 different clusters in 2014 and 2015. Clusters 4, 5 and 6 have a high variability in house prices, with a wide range and several outliers. The outliers are high price points, indicating that there are some houses that are much more expensive than the typical house in the cluster.

In year 2014, clusters like 2, 5, and 8 show a relatively higher range of prices with a significant number of outliers above the upper whisker, suggesting a few properties sold at substantially higher prices than typical. Clusters like 1 and 10 show lower price ranges and fewer outliers, indicating more uniform pricing.

In year 2015, the price distributions are generally tighter, as seen in clusters 3, 4, and 5, with fewer extreme outliers compared to 2014. Clusters 7 and 9 in 2015 show a notable number of lower outliers, which might suggest some properties sold at unusually low prices.

Some clusters show a shift in median prices from 2014 to 2015. For instance, clusters 2, 3, and 5 appear to have higher medians in 2014 compared to 2015, suggesting a possible decrease in typical property prices within these clusters.

The year 2014 displays more variability in prices across most clusters, with wider boxes and more outliers. This suggests a less stable market or a wider range of property values. In contrast, 2015 shows tighter boxes for several clusters, suggesting a more stable or homogeneous property price range.

There are more significant outliers (especially on the upper side) in 2014 than in 2015. This could indicate that while the average prices might have stabilized, 2014 had more high-value transactions.
These observations might be influenced by various factors such as changes in the real estate market, economic conditions, or cluster characteristics that year. Overall, the box plots provide a concise visualization of how property prices distributed and varied across different clusters and years, highlighting trends and anomalies in the market.

Clusters like 1, 8, 9, and 10 seem to have a lower variability, with narrower boxes and fewer outliers. Natually, it raises the question: what will affect the prices and why are these houses so expensive?
