Through the box plot of the data, I can visualize the distribution of house prices across 10 different clusters Clusters 3, 7 and 9 have a high variability in house prices, with a wide range and several outliers. The outliers are high price points, indicating that there are some houses that are much more expensive than the typical house in the cluster.

Clusters like 4, 6, 8, and 10 seem to have a lower variability, with narrower boxes and fewer outliers. Natually, it raises the question: what will affect the prices and why are these houses so expensive?
