The x-axis represents the price of houses in King County, while the y-axis denotes the density of the distribution, illustrating how the data is spread across different price points. The histogram's bars display the frequency or density of houses within specific price ranges, where a taller bar indicates a higher concentration of houses priced within that range.

The inclusion of a density curve aids in visualizing the distribution's shape and spread. The peak of this curve, or the mode of the distribution, is shown in blue text on the plot, indicating the most common house price. The options below allows users to select two individual clusters simultaneously for comparison. The users can compare the house prices for different clusters in the same year or the same cluster in different years. This functionality is particularly useful for understanding how house price distributions vary by area and time.

After exploring the densities for each clusters, the overall prices from 2014 to 2015 have a slight increasing trend, clusters 3, 4, 5 and 7 have increased more than the others through these two years. The modes of the house prices are significantly higher for clusters 2, 3 and 5 compared to the mode of the aggregated data from all clusters. This implies that the most common house prices in these clusters are significantly above the most common house prices observed across the entire data set. This observation may reflect localized economic conditions or property features in these clusters that elevate property values more than in other areas.
