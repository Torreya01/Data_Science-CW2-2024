The data is categorized into 10 different clusters via k-means and plotted on the map focused on the King County, USA. Each cluster is represented by a unique color. K-means is a popular clustering algorithm used in data analysis and machine learning to partition a set of observations into a specified number of clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

Some clusters like 2, 4, 5 and 6 are more densely packed, indicating areas with high housing density or popular residential areas. Other clusters are more spread out, which reflects the population density or the type of housing available in those areas are not that many. Especially for cluster 1 and 9, they have less houses in these regions and might represent suburban or rural areas for these clusters.

Cluster 8 appears quite isolated and far from other clusters, located at higher latitudes and longitudes. This might indicate a unique geographic or socioeconomic area. We can see on the map that it could be a distinct community separated from central urban areas.
